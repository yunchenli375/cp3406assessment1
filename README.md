Date: October 5, 2025
Executive Summary
This report presents a proposal for the development of CareLink, an Elderly Care Coordination Platform designed to address the challenges faced by caregivers of seniors with special needs, such as dementia or chronic illnesses. The app aims to streamline coordination among family members, professional caregivers, and the elderly themselves by providing real-time updates, reminders, and collaborative tools. Drawing from Scenario 2: Elderly Care, the proposal identifies key problems like task oversight and communication gaps in an aging population. Through competitor analysis, CareLink differentiates itself with features like real-time alerts and dementia-specific tracking, while avoiding subscription fees. The development timeline aligns with course milestones, utilizing technologies such as Jetpack Compose, Room database, and Firebase. This report outlines the problem, target audience, features, design, and implementation plan, concluding with recommendations for next steps.
Introduction
As part of CP3406 Assignment 1, this proposal introduces CareLink, a mobile application focused on elderly care coordination. The app targets the growing need for efficient caregiving solutions amid an aging global population. Caregivers often expend significant time and effort managing medications, appointments, and daily routines, leading to stress, confusion, and errors. CareLink seeks to mitigate these issues by fostering collaborative caregiving through intuitive, real-time features.
Problem Statement
Caring for elderly individuals, particularly those with conditions like dementia, requires heightened vigilance and coordination. Primary caregivers, such as family members, frequently struggle with:

Coordinating tasks (e.g., medications, doctor's appointments, and daily routines) with other relatives or professionals.
Overlooking critical tasks due to poor communication.
Managing increased demands as populations age, exacerbating stress and potential health risks for the elderly.

A representative scenario involves Mark, a primary caregiver for his mother with dementia. He faces ongoing challenges in sharing updates and schedules, resulting in missed tasks and heightened anxiety. This issue is increasingly prevalent, underscoring the urgency for a dedicated platform.
Target Audience
CareLink is tailored to users who may not have advanced technical skills or resources. The primary user groups include:

Family Caregivers: Individuals like Mark, responsible for daily elderly care, often with limited time and support.
Extended Relatives and Professional Caregivers: Secondary supporters who need seamless access to updates and schedules.
Elderly Individuals: Those with dementia, chronic illnesses, or living alone while their children are away for extended periods. The app emphasizes simplicity for users with lower education levels or cognitive impairments.

The design prioritizes accessibility, reducing barriers to adoption and ensuring collaborative benefits for all stakeholders.
Competitor Analysis
To position CareLink effectively, two key competitors were evaluated: Caring Village and Caily. The analysis highlights strengths, weaknesses, and CareLink's unique advantages.
Caring Village

Strengths: Offers a community calendar, document storage, and medication lists for basic coordination.
Weaknesses: Lacks real-time updates and robust notifications; not optimized for dementia-specific needs.
CareLink Advantage: Introduces real-time alerts, dementia progress tracking, and enhanced collaboration tools to address these gaps.

Caily

Strengths: Facilitates health information sharing and provides emergency access features.
Weaknesses: Features are limited and broadly focused, lacking depth in customization and user-friendly interfaces.
CareLink Advantage: Provides customizable alerts, an intuitive dashboard for quick overviews, and operates without subscription fees, making it more accessible.

Overall, CareLink builds on competitors' foundations by emphasizing real-time functionality, specificity to elderly conditions, and cost-free access, thereby filling market voids.
Proposed Features
CareLink incorporates a suite of features to directly tackle identified caregiving challenges. These include:

Profiles and Caregiver Invitations: Users can create personalized profiles and invite family members or professionals to join a shared care network.
Medication and Appointment Tracking: Tools for logging schedules with automated reminders to prevent oversights.
Daily Routines and Document Sharing: Secure logging of routines and sharing of important documents (e.g., medical records) among caregivers.
Dashboard, Calendar, Notifications, and Chat: A central dashboard for at-a-glance updates; a calendar view for scheduling; push notifications for alerts; and an integrated chat feed for real-time communication.

These features promote clarity, reduce stress, and enhance coordination, with a focus on security and ease of use.
Mockups and Design
The user interface (UI) will adhere to Material Design guidelines, implemented via Jetpack Compose for a modern, responsive Android experience. Key screens include:

Dashboard: A clean, centralized view displaying all recent updates, tasks, and alerts.
Calendar View: An interactive schedule for visualizing appointments and routines.
Notification Center: A dedicated hub for reminders, messages, and real-time notifications.

Design principles emphasize simplicity and accessibility, ensuring the app is intuitive for elderly users and those with limited tech proficiency. Mockups (not included in this report but referenced in the original presentation) illustrate these elements, with a focus on minimalistic layouts to avoid overwhelming users.
(Note: An image referenced as "image1.jpg" in the source material likely depicts a sample mockup or UI element, but details are not available here.)
Timeline and Milestones
Development will follow a structured timeline aligned with the course schedule:

Weeks 6â€“7: Create wireframes and implement UI layouts using Jetpack Compose.
Week 8: Integrate the Room database for local data storage and management.
Week 9: Implement Firebase authentication for secure user access and push notifications for real-time alerts.
Week 10: Conduct testing, debugging, and final polish to ensure functionality and user experience.

This phased approach allows for iterative progress and risk mitigation.
GitHub and Version Control
Project management will utilize GitHub for version control. Key practices include:

Frequent commits to document incremental changes and facilitate code reviews.
A comprehensive README file outlining features, design rationale, and setup instructions.
Branching strategies to track development progress and enable collaboration.

The repository link will be provided upon setup (e.g., [Your Repo] as placeholder).
Conclusion and Recommendations
CareLink represents a practical solution to the escalating challenges of elderly caregiving, offering real-time coordination, customizable tools, and secure sharing to alleviate stress and prevent errors. By addressing shortcomings in existing apps like Caring Village and Caily, CareLink positions itself as an accessible, feature-rich alternative without financial barriers.
Next steps include proceeding with implementation as per the timeline, followed by rigorous testing. Future enhancements could explore integration with wearable devices for health monitoring. This proposal invites feedback to refine the app further.
